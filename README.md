All required project files for DAT1030
The purpose of this project was to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between Critics Scores and Global Sales for specific genres of video games, namely Sports and Shooter type games, and how they compare to the average.  

This project was completed and archived on 11/24/2020.

To begin a sub-table was created, which only listed the genre, global sales number and critics score awarded. This table was transformed for further analysis, including the removal of null values and data ordering. 

For the purposes of this project, data was used for 1193 sports games and 939 shooter games. The all games genre included every valid entry in the data set, for a total of 16,717 entries. 

Using this table, further sub-tables were created to aggregate statistics for each of the focus genres. These summaries included the average Critics Score, as well as the maximum, minimum and average global sales, and the distribution of global sales for each genre. 

These statistics allowed us to compare Sports and Shooter type games directly. Through this analysis, it was found that sports games had a higher average criticâ€™s score (71.963) compared to shooter games (70.169). It was also noted that sports games had a much higher maximum sales value (83) when compared with shooter games (15), and a sports game had the highest overall sales of any genre. 
It must also be noted that a significant portion of both genres had maximum sales values equal to or less than 1 (89% of sports games, 86% of shooter games), suggesting that both genres carry a high degree of risk. It is worth noting however that the average earnings from shooter games generally outperform sports games. Through this analysis, we can conclude that sports games offer a much higher potential payoff when compared with shooter games, but also carry with them more risk, since average earnings are less.
