The following transformations were applied to the data:

1) A sub-table was created called Sales Genre, with columns for Genre, Global Sales and Critic Score 
2) The Global Sales column values were rounded
3) The data was filtered to exclude null values for Critics Score
4) The table was ranked by Critics Score, Highest to Lowest

The SQL commands used to transform the data are listed below.


CREATE TABLE sales_genre 
(
Genre string,
Global_Sales float,
Critic_Score int
);

INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE sales_genre
SELECT Genre, Global_Sales, Critic_Score
FROM sales;

INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE sales_genre
SELECT Genre, ROUND(Global_Sales), Critic_Score  
FROM sales_genre;

INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE sales_genre
SELECT *
FROM sales_genre
WHERE Critic_Score >0;

INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE sales_genre
SELECT *
FROM sales_genre
ORDER BY Critic_Score DESC;
